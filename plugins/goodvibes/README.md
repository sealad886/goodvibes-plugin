## Why GoodVibes?

### Token Efficiency

Token consumption in AI coding sessions follows a layered pattern: individual operations add tokens, round trips resend conversation context, sessions accumulate state, and knowledge either persists or gets rediscovered. GoodVibes optimizes all seven layers.

#### Layer 1: Per-Operation Savings

Native tools return maximum output regardless of need. Precision tools let you request exactly the detail level required.

*Note: Token estimates below are for typical small-to-medium files (~50-100 lines). Savings scale linearly with file size (e.g., a 500-line file would be ~5,000 tokens native vs. the same low precision overhead).*

| Operation | Native Tool | Precision Tool | Savings |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| Check if a file exists | `Read` returns full content (~500+ tokens) | `precision_read` with `count_only` (~15 tokens) | ~97% |
| Count files matching a pattern | `Glob` returns all paths (~200+ tokens) | `precision_glob` with `count_only` (~15 tokens) | ~92% |
| Check if a pattern exists in code | `Grep` returns all matches with context (~300+ tokens) | `precision_grep` with `count_only` (~15 tokens) | ~95% |
| Re-read an unchanged file | `Read` returns full content again (~500+ tokens) | `precision_read` returns cache hit (~20 tokens) | ~96% |
| Get function signatures from a file | `Read` returns entire file (~500+ tokens) | `precision_read` with `symbols` extract (~50 tokens) | ~90% |

**Mechanisms:**
- **Verbosity levels** (4-6 per tool): `count_only`, `files_only`, `minimal`, `standard`, `verbose`. Tools default to minimal output automatically — `precision_edit` defaults to `minimal`, `precision_grep` to `files_only`, `precision_glob` to `paths_only`. Savings are automatic even without explicit requests.
- **Extract modes** (`precision_read`): `content`, `outline`, `symbols`, `ast`, `lines`. Get function signatures (~50 tokens) instead of full file content (~500+ tokens). 75-95% savings.
- **Token budget pagination**: Large results auto-paginate to stay within a specified token limit. Prevents single responses from consuming disproportionate context.
- **AST pattern matching** (`precision_edit`): More precise than regex, fewer false positives, fewer failed edits requiring retry.

#### Layer 2: Per-Round-Trip Savings

Every API call resends the entire conversation (system prompt + tool definitions + all messages). Fewer calls = less overhead.

- **Batch operations**: Read 10 files, edit 5 files, run 3 commands, fetch 5 URLs — each in a single tool call. Eliminates N-1 round trips.
- **discover tool**: Runs grep + glob + symbol queries simultaneously in one call. Results keyed by query ID. 5 searches in 1 round trip instead of 5.
- **Atomic transactions**: `precision_edit` and `precision_write` in atomic mode. If any operation fails, all roll back. Prevents partial failures that require re-investigation (which costs more round trips).

Quick example:
```
Reading 10 files:
  Native: 10 calls x (full conversation prefix resent each time)
  Precision: 1 call x (conversation prefix sent once)
  = 9 fewer prefix resends
```

#### Layer 3: Per-Session Savings

State tracked within a session avoids redundant work.

- **File state caching**: SHA256 hash-based. Re-reading an unchanged file returns ~20 tokens instead of full content. In edit-verify-edit cycles, this compounds rapidly.
- **Search cache**: Last 20 grep results stored by query ID. Enables incremental refinement without re-running expensive searches.
- **Stack detection caching**: `detect_stack` results cached to `.goodvibes/detected-stack.json`. Re-detection skipped within session.
- **Context injection at session start**: SessionStart hook gathers context types in parallel (stack, git, environment, TODOs, health, folder structure, memory, ports) and injects them upfront. Agents skip discovery.
- **Conditional context sections**: Context builder omits healthy sections entirely. If no health warnings exist, no health section is injected. Saves 200-500 tokens on healthy projects.
- **Subagent context pre-loading**: SubagentStart hook injects project name, git branch, and stack info into every subagent at spawn. No per-agent discovery needed.

#### Layer 4: Cross-Session Savings

Knowledge persists across conversations. Same problem next week? Already documented.

- **Memory system**: `.goodvibes/memory/` stores decisions, patterns, failures, and preferences in structured JSON. Agents read memory before acting. An agent that would spend 5K+ tokens debugging a known issue instead reads a 200-token failure record.
- **PostToolUseFailure logging**: Failed tool attempts are logged with root cause and prevention guidance. Future sessions inherit this knowledge automatically.
- **Learn-and-abandon pattern**: Fix attempts are capped. If the issue is upstream (in a package you can't change), you don't burn tokens trying to fix it again — every future session reads the failure record and skips the investigation entirely.

#### Layer 5: Infrastructure Savings (Dual-Layer Caching)

Precision engine's local file cache and Anthropic's remote prompt cache operate at different layers and compound:

| Layer | What It Does | Impact |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| **Local (MCP)** | Caches file state by content hash | Shrinks token volume added to conversation |
| **Remote (Anthropic)** | Caches conversation prefix | Discounts per-token cost for cached turns |

Without local caching, re-reading a file adds full content to the conversation every time. With local caching, only the first read adds full content; subsequent reads return cache hits (~20 tokens each). This keeps the conversation prefix smaller.

Since Anthropic's prompt cache pricing uses multipliers (cache reads at ~10% of base input price), a smaller prefix means cheaper cache operations on every turn.

```
Re-reading a 500-line file 3 times during a session:
  Native tools:  5,000 + 5,000 + 5,000 = 15,000 tokens added to conversation
  Precision:     5,000 + 20 + 20       = 5,040 tokens added

Over 20 files read multiple times:
  Native:    ~100K+ tokens x cache rates = expensive prefix
  Precision: ~20K tokens x cache rates   = 80% reduction in cache cost
```

**Context window longevity:** Slower conversation growth delays context compaction. Compaction rewrites the conversation prefix, which means the remote cache no longer matches, requiring a new cache write. Precision caching keeps the remote cache hot longer, avoiding repeated cold starts.

#### Layer 6: Prevention Savings

Structured error handling prevents expensive failure cascades.

- **3-phase fix loop**: Systematic escalation (internal -> docs -> community -> internet) with capped attempts instead of random debugging that burns tokens.
- **Blocker classification**: Output style classifies blockers by type (issue/error/other) with specific recovery strategies. Structured response = targeted fix = fewer wasted tokens.
- **Atomic transactions with rollback**: Failed batch operations roll back cleanly. No partial corruption requiring manual investigation.

#### Layer 7: Orchestration Savings

The output style enforces patterns that keep the entire agent tree efficient.

- **Orchestrator stays lean**: "You ARE the orchestrator. Coordination, NOT implementation." The main context — the most expensive one because it persists across the whole session — never bloats with file contents or grep results. All implementation happens in subagent contexts that are discarded after completion.
- **Mandatory precision tools for all agents**: The output style and PreToolUse hook force precision tools across the entire agent tree. One rogue subagent using native `Read` in a loop would burn thousands of tokens. This prevents it.
- **Planned execution**: "Gather->Plan->Apply Workflow" means agents execute targeted operations instead of speculative exploration. Pre-meditated work = fewer wasted reads and searches.
- **Parallel agents with background execution**: Agents run concurrently in the background (Default = 6 concurrent, can be increased). Parallel execution plus explicit instructions not to monitor agents via Task Output unless absolutely necessary (and even then to use the non-blocking version), and to wait for a Task Completion notification means fewer wasted tokens and the ability to keep conversing and planning in the main conversation context while work is done in the background.

#### Summary

These seven layers compound: per-operation savings reduce round-trip overhead, which shrinks per-session context growth, which delays compaction, which keeps the remote cache hot, while cross-session memory prevents rediscovering solved problems, and orchestration patterns ensure the entire agent tree operates efficiently. For API users paying per token, this directly reduces cost. For Pro/Max subscribers, it means less of your weekly allocation consumed per session, allowing more work before hitting limits.

### Transparent Tool Upgrade

A PreToolUse hook intercepts Claude's native Read, Edit, Write, Glob, and Grep calls and redirects them to precision equivalents. The hook fires on every tool call — Claude requests `Read`, the hook blocks it and tells Claude to use `precision_read` instead. This happens for all agents including subagents. Once this behavior has been recorded in memory, native tool use is rarely attempted.

This means the efficiency gains are automatic — Claude uses precision tools without configuration.

### 11 Specialized Agents

Domain-specific agents (engineer, reviewer, tester, architect, deployer, 3 integrators, planner, 2 factories) each bring focused expertise. Opus-powered agents handle complex work; Sonnet-powered agents handle high-volume tasks.

### Persistent Memory

A two-tier memory system stores decisions, patterns, failures, and preferences in `.goodvibes/memory/`. Agents read these files before acting. The PostToolUseFailure hook automatically logs failures after exhausting its 3-phase fix loop. Same bug next session? Already documented.

### Quality Loops

WRFC (Work-Review-Fix-Check) is a mandatory quality cycle enforced on every unit of work. The runtime engine drives these loops autonomously — the orchestrator spawns work, and the engine handles review, fix, and completion via directives.

**The cycle:**

```
1. WORK    →  Orchestrator spawns agent to implement the task
2. REVIEW  →  Runtime engine auto-spawns reviewer (directive-driven)
3. FIX     →  If issues found, engine spawns fixer (directive-driven)
4. CHECK   →  Engine re-reviews until zero issues remain
5. COMPLETE →  Engine issues complete directive → git commit + log update
```

**How it works:**

- **Directive-driven**: The runtime engine's WRFC plugin evaluates review scores, decides whether to fix or complete, and issues `<gv>` directives that the orchestrator executes mechanically. The orchestrator does not decide when to review or fix — the engine does.
- **Per-task isolation**: Each unit of work gets its own WRFC workflow with independent state tracking.
- **All agents run in background**: The orchestrator coordinates; it never implements. Up to 6 concurrent WRFC chains. (Default = 6, can be configured)
- **No issue is too minor**: Reviewers flag everything — major, minor, nitpick. All must be addressed before the chain completes. (Minimum review score can be configured)
- **Iterative convergence**: Fix → Check repeats until the reviewer returns zero issues or max attempts are reached. Default for max attempts is 3 loops where a single loop contains 4 separate attempts to fix a problem by gathering additional information and retrying. In an interactive Vibecoding session, the user can direct the flow after max retries; In an automated Justvibes session, failures are documented for later examination.
- **Failure logging**: If max fix attempts are exhausted, the failure is recorded in `.goodvibes/memory/failures.json` with root cause and prevention guidance.
- **Score-gated completion**: Code is only committed after the reviewer confirms a passing score. The threshold is configurable per workflow.

### Two Execution Modes

vibecoding (interactive: shows progress, explains decisions, asks on ambiguity) and justvibes (autonomous: silent execution, auto-chains tasks, logs everything).

## Installation

### Claude Code plugin install

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add mgd34msu/goodvibes-plugin
claude plugin install goodvibes@goodvibes-market
```

After installation, run the Setup hook to pre-write CLAUDE.md chain files:
```bash
claude --init-only
```

This ensures all GoodVibes instruction files are in place before your first session. On each session start, the SessionStart hook:
- Detects your project stack (frameworks, languages, tools)
- Analyzes git status (branch, uncommitted changes)
- Checks project health (missing dependencies, build issues)
- Verifies CLAUDE.md chain files (writes/appends any that are missing)
- Injects project context into Claude's system message

Set your output style:
```bash
/output-style goodvibes:vibecoding   # Interactive mode
/output-style goodvibes:justvibes    # Autonomous mode
```

### GitHub Copilot install

```bash
npm install
npm run install:copilot --workspace=plugins/goodvibes
```

This writes:
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- `.github/instructions/goodvibes.instructions.md`

## Runtime Engine — 7 Tools

Event-driven orchestration backbone. Manages WRFC quality loops, event-driven triggers, workflow state machines, and agent coordination. Runs as a persistent process with Unix domain socket IPC.

| `runtime_triggers` | Manage event triggers: list, create, enable/disable, test conditions. Declarative event-driven automation |
| `runtime_agents` | Manage coordinated agents: spawn with workflow context, track WRFC chains, monitor budgets, view execution plans |

### Architecture

Three-layer design separating generic event processing from domain-specific behavior:

**Layer 1 — Core** (generic event loop):
- **EventQueue**: Binary min-heap with O(log n) enqueue, priority ordering, dedup TTL, cancel by ID/ref
- **EventProcessor**: Tick-driven processing loop with backpressure detection and budget limits
- **TriggerRegistry**: Pattern-based event matching with glob support and LRU cache
- **StateStore**: Debounced JSON persistence with structuredClone snapshots
- **LoopLifecycleManager**: State machine (stopped → running → paused → draining → stopped)
- **ErrorHandler**: Retry engine (fixed/exponential backoff) with dead-letter queue routing
- **EventMetrics**: Rolling window statistics (latency, chain depth, per-trigger/per-type counts)
- **DeadLetterQueue**: Failed event storage with max-size eviction and optional disk persistence

**Layer 2 — Extensions** (typed event/trigger factories):
- 5 event factories: agent, hook, time, external, human — each producing typed `RuntimeEvent` payloads
- 4 trigger factories: WRFC, cron, webhook, and generic — with condition builders and type guards

**Layer 3 — Plugins** (domain implementations):
- **WRFC Plugin**: Score evaluation, directive building, quality gate handlers, review/fix orchestration
- **Time Plugin**: Heartbeat monitoring, cron-style scheduling with dirty-flag persistence
- **External Plugin**: File watcher (polling with dedup), HTTP webhook listener (SHA-256 auth), pluggable normalizers
- **Hook Processing Plugin**: Maps Claude Code hook events to runtime events via priority-sorted registry

### Executor Modes

The runtime engine supports three execution modes that determine how events are processed:

| | Engaged | Daemon | Hybrid |
|---|---|---|---|
| **When** | Human present, interactive session | Session processes event queue autonomously | Engaged session that also processes queued events |
| **Context** | Accumulates naturally | Clears after each event batch | Accumulates, processes queue between interactions |
| **Event sources** | `human:*`, `internal:*`, `agent:*` | `time:*`, `external:*`, `agent:*` | All sources |
| **Tick mechanism** | Human drives the session | System scheduler (systemd/cron/launchd) sends ticks | Human drives + queue drains between interactions |
| **Memory injection** | At session start + compaction recovery | Before every event batch | Both |

**Mode selection**: Explicit via config/command, inferred from session origin (tmux cron tick → daemon, human → engaged), or hybrid by default in engaged sessions with queued events.

### Key Capabilities

- **Directive-driven WRFC**: Autonomous Work → Review → Fix → Check loops managed by the engine, not the orchestrator
- **Event-driven triggers**: Declarative conditions that fire handlers when matching events arrive
- **Workflow state machines**: Formal state tracking for WRFC chains and fix loops with cancellation support
- **Five event sources**: Time (heartbeats, crons), human (prompts, approvals), external (webhooks), internal (hooks), and agent (inter-agent) — all entering a single priority queue
- **Circuit breakers**: Chain depth limits, max fires per trigger, cooldowns, global queue depth limits, and cost budgets
- **Unix socket IPC**: Low-latency communication between hooks, MCP tools, and the runtime process
- **Plugin architecture**: Layer 3 plugins register event types, triggers, and handlers at startup — extensible without modifying core

## Registry Engine — 7 Tools

Discovery and search layer for skills, agents, and tools. Uses Fuse.js fuzzy search indexed over YAML registry files. Supports deferred loading — tools are registered only when activated via `ToolSearch`.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search_skills` | Keyword/semantic search over the 25-skill registry |
| `search_agents` | Search the 11-agent registry by expertise area |
| `search_tools` | Search the 73-tool registry by functionality |
| `recommend_skills` | Analyze a task description and recommend relevant skills with context classification |
| `get_skill_content` | Load a skill's full content into context for immediate use |
| `get_agent_content` | Load an agent definition into context |
| `skill_dependencies` | Resolve a skill's dependency chain (all transitively required skills) |

Key capabilities:
- **Fuzzy search**: Fuse.js with weighted fields (description 0.4, name 0.3, keywords 0.3) and relevance scoring
- **Lazy loading**: server starts instantly; registry indexes are loaded on first use (single-flight pattern)
- **Deferred tools**: all 7 tools use `defer_loading: true` — loaded on-demand via `ToolSearch` to minimize startup cost
- **Three registries**: skills (25), agents (11), tools (73) — each indexed independently with Fuse.js

## Agents

11 specialized agents with distinct expertise. The orchestrator spawns them for focused tasks — each consults memory, applies relevant skills, and returns results.

| Agent | Model | Specialization |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| engineer | Opus | Full-stack: APIs, databases, auth, components, routing, styling |
| reviewer | Opus | Code quality, security, type safety, WRFC loop execution |
| tester | Sonnet | Test generation, coverage analysis, fixture creation, 100% coverage goal |
| architect | Opus | System design, architecture decisions, dependency mapping |
| deployer | Sonnet | CI/CD, Docker, cloud deployment (Vercel, AWS, Railway, Fly.io) |
| integrator-ai | Opus | AI/LLM integrations (OpenAI, Anthropic, Vercel AI SDK, RAG, embeddings) |
| integrator-services | Sonnet | Payments (Stripe), email (Resend), CMS (Sanity, Contentful), uploads (S3, Cloudinary) |
| integrator-state | Sonnet | State management (Zustand, Redux, Jotai, TanStack Query), forms, real-time |
| planner | Opus | Task breakdown, batch planning, workflow orchestration |
| agent-factory | Opus | Create new specialized agents |
| skill-factory | Opus | Create new skills and slash commands |

## Skills - 25 Total

Organized into 4 tiers with progressive loading — protocol skills are always active, others load when relevant to the task.

| Tier | Count | Skills | Loading |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| **Protocol** | 5 | precision-mastery, gather-plan-apply, review-scoring, goodvibes-memory, error-recovery | Always active |
| **Orchestration** | 2 | task-orchestration, fullstack-feature | On multi-agent tasks |
| **Outcome** | 11 | ai-integration, api-design, authentication, component-architecture, database-layer, deployment, payment-integration, service-integration, state-management, styling-system, testing-strategy | When task matches domain |
| **Quality** | 7 | accessibility-audit, code-review, debugging, performance-audit, project-onboarding, refactoring, security-audit | On review/audit tasks |

**Protocol skills** are embedded in every agent's context via the subagent protocol chain — they're too critical for token efficiency and execution patterns to depend on lazy loading.

**Outcome and quality skills** load proactively when Claude detects a matching task. Each skill includes a `## Resources` tree pointing to scripts and reference materials the agent can navigate as needed.

**Fallback**: If a skill doesn't load automatically, the registry engine's `get_skill_content` tool serves as an escape hatch.

## Hooks - 11 Types

Lifecycle hooks run transparently on every session. They're the mechanism behind tool redirection, context injection, and automatic error recovery.

| Hook | Trigger | What It Does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Setup | `claude --init` / `claude --init-only` | Pre-writes CLAUDE.md chain files (import directives + prompt files) so they exist before any session starts. Matches `init` trigger. Avoids race conditions where SessionStart isn't fast enough to write files before Claude reads them |
| PreToolUse (Bash) | Before Bash execution | Platform path mapping (Windows/Linux), shell safety analysis, git commit quality gates |
| PreToolUse (Native) | Before Read/Edit/Write/Glob/Grep | Blocks native tool, redirects to precision-engine equivalent |
| PostToolUseFailure | After Bash failure | 3-phase progressive fix loop: Phase 1 (internal knowledge) -> Phase 2 (official docs hints) -> Phase 3 (community docs hints). Logs failures to `.goodvibes/memory/failures.json` after all phases exhausted |
| SessionStart | Session begins | Detects project stack, analyzes git status, checks project health, creates/updates CLAUDE.md, injects context into system message, builds project file index |
| SessionEnd | Session ends | Persists session state |
| SubagentStart | Agent spawns | Injects context for GoodVibes agents (stack info, git branch, project name), emits agent:spawned event to runtime engine |
| SubagentStop | Agent completes | Emits agent:completed event to runtime engine, triggers WRFC directive evaluation |
| PreCompact | Before context compaction | Creates checkpoint commit if uncommitted changes exist, generates session summary |
| Stop | Stop button pressed | Saves current state |
| UserPromptSubmit | User sends message | Drains pending WRFC directives from runtime engine, injects into orchestrator context |

## Output Styles

Two execution modes for different workflows. Set via `/output-style goodvibes:vibecoding` or `/output-style goodvibes:justvibes`.

| Setting | vibecoding | justvibes |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Description | Autonomous coding with communication | Fully autonomous silent execution |
| show_progress | true | false |
| explain_decisions | true | false |
| ask_on_ambiguity | true | false |
| auto_chain | false | true |
| max_autonomous_batches | 1 | unlimited |
| checkpoint_frequency | per_batch | per_phase |
| parallel_agents | 6 | 6 |
| recovery (issues/errors) | ask_user_with_options | fix_review_loop |
| recovery (other) | ask_user | choose_best_option_silent |
| max_fix_attempts | 3 | 3 |
| fix_attempt strategy | one_shot (all sources at once) | cumulative (staged escalation) |
| default output mode | standard | minimal |
| show_diffs | true | false |
| show_telemetry | summary | none |
| log_activity | false | true |

## Memory System

Two-tier persistent memory. Session logs track the current session. Cross-session memory persists across conversations.

### Session Logs (`.goodvibes/logs/`)

- `decisions.md` — Architectural choices with options considered, rationale, implications
- `errors.md` — Failures categorized by type (TOOL_FAILURE, BUILD_ERROR, TEST_FAILURE, etc.) with root cause and resolution
- `activity.md` — Completed work that passed review (primarily used in justvibes mode)

### Cross-Session Memory (`.goodvibes/memory/`)

- `decisions.json` — Decision records with category, scope, confidence (max 1000 entries, auto-prunes oldest)
- `patterns.json` — Proven approaches with example files and keywords (max 500)
- `failures.json` — Failed approaches with root cause and prevention guidance (max 500)
- `preferences.json` — User conventions (code style, naming, patterns)

Agents read memory before acting. The PostToolUseFailure hook automatically records failures after its 3-phase fix loop is exhausted.

## Telemetry

Built-in telemetry tracks tool usage, session activity, and performance metrics in a local SQLite database (sql.js WASM). Query via `precision_config action=telemetry` with filters for tool, status, session_id, and date range. All data stays local — nothing is sent externally.

## Configuration

GoodVibes works out of the box. Minimal configuration needed.

### Path Sandboxing

Controls whether precision tools can access files outside the project root. Disabled by default.

```bash
/goodvibes:sandbox true    # Enable (restrict to project root)
/goodvibes:sandbox false   # Disable (allow external paths, default)
```

### Service Registry

Named API services with stored credentials for precision_fetch auto-auth:

```bash
/goodvibes:services add Github    # Configure a new API service
/goodvibes:services list          # Show registered services
/goodvibes:services test Github   # Test service connectivity
```

### Output Style

Switch execution modes:

```bash
/output-style goodvibes:vibecoding
/output-style goodvibes:justvibes
```

## Slash Commands

| Command | Purpose |
